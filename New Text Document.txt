To **add a graph showing present vs absent employees**, you can use a **doughnut chart** or a **bar chart**. A **doughnut chart** is better for showing proportions, while a **bar chart** is good for comparing numbers.

Here‚Äôs how you can add a **doughnut chart** showing "Present" vs "Absent" employees:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. Add This Blade Section Inside `.content` (e.g. after other cards)

```blade
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <div class="card card-info">
      <div class="card-header">
        <h3 class="card-title">Employee Attendance (Today)</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="card-body">
        <canvas id="attendanceStatusChart" style="min-height: 250px; height: 250px;"></canvas>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Pass These Variables From Controller

In your `DashboardController`, calculate and pass:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use App\Models\Attendance;
use Carbon\Carbon;

$today = Carbon::today()->toDateString();
$totalEmployees = User::where('is_role', 3)->count(); // Assuming role 3 = employee

$presentToday = Attendance::where('date', $today)->distinct('employee_number')->count('employee_number');
$absentToday = $totalEmployees - $presentToday;

return view('your_dashboard_view', [
    // other variables...
    'presentToday' => $presentToday,
    'absentToday' => $absentToday,
]);
```

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Add Chart Script in `@section('script')`

Append this to your existing JS:

```js
var attendanceStatusCtx = $('#attendanceStatusChart').get(0).getContext('2d');

var attendanceData = {
  labels: ['Present', 'Absent'],
  datasets: [{
    data: [{{ $presentToday }}, {{ $absentToday }}],
    backgroundColor: ['#28a745', '#dc3545'],
  }]
};

var attendanceOptions = {
  maintainAspectRatio: false,
  responsive: true,
};

new Chart(attendanceStatusCtx, {
  type: 'doughnut',
  data: attendanceData,
  options: attendanceOptions
});
```

---

### ‚úÖ Done!

Now your dashboard will show a live chart of how many employees are **present vs absent today**.

Let me know if you want to make it date-selectable or exportable.



GET THE LIST OF ABSENT EMPLOYEES

Here‚Äôs how to **display a table of absent employees** under your new "Present vs Absent" chart.

---

### ‚úÖ 1. In Your Controller

Make sure you're getting the absent employees correctly. For example:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use App\Models\Attendance;
use Carbon\Carbon;

$today = Carbon::today()->toDateString();

// Get IDs of employees who clocked in today
$presentEmployeeIds = Attendance::where('date', $today)->pluck('employee_number')->toArray();

// Get employees who did NOT clock in today
$absentEmployees = User::where('is_role', 3) // assuming 3 = employee
    ->whereNotIn('admission_number', $presentEmployeeIds)
    ->get();

return view('your_dashboard_view', [
    'absentEmployees' => $absentEmployees,
    'presentToday' => count($presentEmployeeIds),
    'absentToday' => $absentEmployees->count(),
    // ... other data
]);
```

---

### ‚úÖ 2. In Your Blade View (`dashboard.blade.php`)

Add this **below the chart**:

```blade
<div class="card mt-3">
  <div class="card-header">
    <h3 class="card-title"><b>Absent Employees Today ({{ \Carbon\Carbon::today()->format('d-m-Y') }})</b></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body table-responsive p-0" style="max-height: 300px; overflow-y:auto;">
    <table class="table table-hover text-nowrap">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Employee Number</th>
          <th>Department</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        @forelse ($absentEmployees as $employee)
        <tr>
          <td>{{ $employee->name }} {{ $employee->last_name }}</td>
          <td>{{ $employee->admission_number }}</td>
          <td>{{ $employee->getDepartment->name ?? 'N/A' }}</td>
        </tr>
        @empty
        <tr>
          <td colspan="3">All employees are present today.</td>
        </tr>
        @endforelse
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
</div>
```

---

### üìù Notes

* This assumes `User` model has a relationship `getDepartment`.
* Adjust `admission_number` if your employee ID field has a different name.
* If needed, I can help you paginate the results or make them searchable.

Let me know if you'd also like to show a list of **present employees** or filter by department.
